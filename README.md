# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This project merged the training and test data sets to create one data set. Only measurements of the mean and standard deviation were extracted for each feature. All activities and features were descriptively labeled.
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. A new tidy data set was produced containing the average of each subject's activity's measurements.

Goals of the Project:

1. Create a script called "run_analysis.R" to clean and tidy the data collected from the accelerometers of Samsung Galaxy S smartphones.

2. All activities and metrics should be labeled descriptively.

3. The script should produce a smaller, tidy data set with the averages of each Subject's Activity's metric that will be saved as a separate text file.

CodeBook.md exists in the repository and describes the variables, the data, and any transformations and work that was performed to clean up the data.
